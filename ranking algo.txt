Creating a ranking algorithm for a search engine can be a complex task, but here are some general steps you can take to create a basic algorithm:

Tokenize the query and documents: Divide the query and each document into individual words or tokens.

Pre-processing: Perform pre-processing steps such as lowercasing, removing stop words, stemming or lemmatization, and removing special characters.

Create an inverted index: An inverted index is a data structure that maps words to the documents that contain them. The inverted index allows you to quickly find all the documents that contain a given word.

Calculate term frequency (tf): The term frequency is the number of times a word appears in a document. You can use tf to determine how relevant a word is to a document.

Calculate inverse document frequency (idf): The inverse document frequency is a measure of how common a word is across all documents. You can use idf to determine how important a word is to the overall collection of documents.

Calculate the tf-idf score for each word in each document: The tf-idf score is a measure of the importance of a word to a document. It is calculated by multiplying the term frequency by the inverse document frequency.

Use the tf-idf scores to rank the documents: You can use the tf-idf scores to rank the documents based on their relevance to the query.

Use other features to improve the search results: You can also use other features such as page rank, anchor text, title, meta tags, etc.

Experiment with different parameters and test the algorithm using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and mean average precision

Continuously monitor the algorithm's performance and adjust the parameters as needed.

It's worth noting that these are the basic steps to create a ranking algorithm, and there are many other factors and techniques that can be used to improve the performance of a search engine. Some of the most popular search engines like Google, Bing and Baidu use machine learning models to improve their ranking algorithm and also use a lot of other features like user's search history, location, etc.
